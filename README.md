# Learn NativeScript Layouts

Inspired by [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/), this is a fun and easy way for you to learn about mobile app layouts with [NativeScript](https://www.nativescript.org). Each level presents a different mobile app view that needs native UI elements laid out a certain way. NativeScript provides a variety of [layout containers](https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/layout-containers) to help with this:

- StackLayout
- WrapLayout
- AbsoluteLayout
- GridLayout
- DockLayout
- FlexboxLayout
